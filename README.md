This project requires **Python 3** and the following Python libraries installed:

- [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/)

You will also need to have software installed to run and execute a [Jupyter Notebook](http://ipython.org/notebook.html)

If you do not have Python installed yet, it is highly recommended that you install the [Anaconda](http://continuum.io/downloads) distribution of Python. Make sure that you select the Python 3.x installer.

### Code

Template code is provided in the `image_classification.ipynb` notebook file.

### Run

In a terminal or command window, navigate to the top-level project directory `image_classification/` (that contains this README) and run one of the following commands:

```bash
ipython notebook image_classification.ipynb
```  
or
```bash
jupyter notebook image_classification.ipynb
```

This will open the Jupyter Notebook software and project file in your browser.
